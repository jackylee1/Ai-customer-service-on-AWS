# AI-customer service on AWS

Implement the five components in this project:

1 .API Layer

- services: API Gateway, Lambda, Cognito, IAM

- Requirements:
  Create a Cognito User Pool
  
  Create a Cognito Identity Provider for the User Pool above
  
  Create an API Gateway API using the following Swagger specification:
  
  https://github.com/001000001/aics-columbia/blob/master/swagger.json (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site. 
  
  Implement the following APIs:

   - /context GET
        Retrieves all the context events for a particular user

   - /biometrics PUT
        Communicate with the biometric layer and save a new biometric photo
   
   - /biometrics/verify POST
        Given an incoming image, verify that the image matches the user

  Enable IAM security on the three API Gateway APIs above

  Modify the Authenticated User IAM role that Cognito creates to allow the role to call the API calls above
 

2 .Context Layer:
 

- Services: Kinesis, Lambda, DynamoDB

- Requirements:
  Given an event sent to Kinesis, trigger a Lambda function, validate and augment the event as necessary and then store it in a DynamoDB table that hosts context

  Use DynamoDBâ€™s expiration feature to expire context events after 15 minutes.
 

3 .Biometric Layer:
 

- Services: Lambda, Rekognition, S3, DynamoDB
- Requirements:
  Create two Lambda functions that
  
   - Given an incoming photo, store it to a specific biometric pool of photos in S3 and store a reference to that S3 file in DynamoDB
   - Given an incoming photo, compare it to a specific biometric pool of photos (references stored in DynamoDB) using Rekognition and return if it is a match or not
 

4 .Chat Layer:
 

- Services: ElasticBeanstalk, Lex, Lambda, S3

- Requirements:
   
   - Build on top of the sample Node.js chat server to handle back and forth chat
     https://github.com/001000001/aics-columbia/tree/master/chat-server (Links to an external site.)Links to an external site.
   
   - Deploy the Node.js server to ElasticBeanstalk
   
   - Use Lex to disambiguate the user utterances
       
       - Add at least 3 intents
   
   - Use Lambda to elicit the Lex slots
   
   - Create a webhook (an endpoint) to receive sentiment analysis results and send them either in an email using SES or back through the chat to the user
   
   - At the end of a conversation store a JSON file in S3 with context surrounding the conversation (conversation id, user id etc.) and the user utterances
 

5 .Analytics Layer:
- Services: S3, Lambda

- Requirements:

   - Given the JSON object stored in S3, trigger a Lambda function that iterates over the user utterances and outputs an overall sentiment for the conversation

   - Send the sentiment analysis back to ElasticBeanstalk to a webhook
